Feedback components communicate system status, user actions, and important information to users. They help create clear communication between your application and its users.

## Available Components

- **[Alert](/components/feedback/alert/)** - Display important messages and notifications to users

## Design Principles

- **Clear Communication**: Messages are concise and actionable
- **Appropriate Urgency**: Visual hierarchy matches the importance of the message
- **Accessible**: Screen reader friendly with proper ARIA attributes
- **Non-Intrusive**: Feedback doesn't unnecessarily interrupt user workflow
