title: Overlay Components
description: Components that appear above other content
---

Overlay components appear above the main content to capture user attention, display additional information, or provide focused interactions without navigating away from the current context.

## Available Components

- **[Modal](/components/overlays/modal/)** - Dialog boxes for important interactions and information

## Design Principles

- **Focus Management**: Proper keyboard trap and focus restoration
- **Escape Routes**: Always provide clear ways to close overlays
- **Backdrop Interaction**: Consistent behavior when clicking outside overlay content
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader announcements and proper ARIA roles
